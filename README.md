## 🧠 Philosophy

    ThirdSpace isn't just another event app. It's the antidote to flaky plans, endless group chats, and social burnout. Think: what Facebook events were supposed to be... but cooler.

# ThirdSpace Feed System - README

This document outlines the architecture, functionality, and development progress of the feed system for the ThirdSpace app, including visual references.

## Overview

The ThirdSpace feed displays dynamic social activity from a user's network, including:

- Friend connections (e.g., friend_accepted)

- Event RSVPs (e.g., joined_event)

- Profile updates

- Events coming up near the user

It supports pagination and is being extended to include infinite scroll capabilities.

## Backend API

### Endpoint

```
GET /api/users/:id/user-feed?page=1&limit=10
```

- Merges two sub-feeds:

  - `generateUserFeed(user, friends, events)`

  - `generateEventFeed(user, events)`

- Sorts results by timestamp

- Returns paginated feed with metadata

### Example Feed Item

```
{
  "id": "688ead8b28802692f9b3ceb9",
  "actor": {
    "eventId": "6886d6cda4b15a3b7a5095a4",
    "eventName": "Dog petting ceremony",
    "location": {
      "name": "Dog petting ceremony",
      "lat": 27.9,
      "lng": -82.8
    },
    "totalAttendance": 0,
    "startingDate": "2025-08-05T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "target": {
    "eventId": "6886d6cda4b15a3b7a5095a4",
    "title": "Dog petting ceremony"
  },
  "type": "event_coming_up",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-05T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Frontend Structure

### Feed Context

Provides feed data to the page:

```
const FeedContext = createContext<FeedContextType | undefined>(undefined);
```

- `items[]`: Feed data

- `loading`: Status

- `refresh()`: Manual refetch

### Main Feed Page

- Auth-protected via `useSession`

- Renders `GreetingHeader` and a list of `FeedItemCard`s

### FeedItemCard

- Handles all rendering logic based on feed `type`

- Dynamic layout depending on type: event, profile update, etc.

### FeedCardFooter

- Renders action/footer content depending on `type`

- Conditional block for `event_coming_up` uses `formatDistanceToNow()` for time

- Includes button linking to event detail page

- **Supported Activity Types**:

  - Hosted events

  - Event RSVPs / attendance

  - Friend requests accepted

  - Profile updates (bio, avatar, location, username, tags, status)

  - Status posts with optional image attachments

- **Real‑Time Updates**:

  - `useSmartFeedRefresh` hook for periodic refresh

  - Displays a **"New Updates"** banner when fresh items are available

  - Merges new and existing items with `mergeFeedItems` to prevent duplicates

- **Responsive Card Design**:

  - `FeedItemCard` component with contextual actions per feed type

  - Type guards (`isEvent`) ensure correct rendering for event vs user activities

  - Mobile‑first, adaptive layout

- **Backend Support**:

  - `/user-feed` endpoint fetches persisted feed data from MongoDB

  - Feed generation functions (`generateUserFeed` / `generateEventFeed`)

  - Deduplication logic on insert to prevent redundant entries

## 🔄 Recent Worklog (July–August 2025)

### 🎯 Status Feed Overhaul (`/feed`)

- ✅ Implemented `status_posted` and `profile_status_updated` feed item types
- ✅ Added logic for self-status visibility (users now see their own posts)
- ✅ Normalized `actor` and `target` structure across feed generators
- ✅ Added timestamp control for smart refreshes and delta-based updates

### 🪓 Data Debugging & Cleanup

- ✅ Discovered malformed feed targets (`ttile` typo, etc.)
- ✅ Wrote a nuke route (`DELETE /api/dev/wipe`) for quick dev resets
- ✅ Refactored `generateUserFeed()` to pull from MongoDB and reduce duplication

### 🐞 Bug Fixes (Big ones)

- 🧠 Fixed JSX bug where attachments were hidden inside a function block
- 🕳️ Tracked down silent fails in `status_posted` feed items due to shape mismatches
- ⚠️ Swiper CSS bugs (extra bottom bar, overflow) patched with deep Tailwind overrides
- ⏱️ Fixed Smart Refresh logic to actually respect timestamp deltas (60s)

### 🎨 Frontend UX

- ✅ SwiperJS integration for photo attachments (status + events)
- ✅ Responsive grid layout for multi-attachment feed cards
- ✅ Fallback for gravatar and username display
- ✅ Tooltips + accessibility cleanups

## 🆕 Recent Update — Location Attachments in Feed

We’ve added support for **location-based profile updates** with image attachments pulled from the **Unsplash API**.

### How it works

- When a user updates their **location** in their profile, the backend now queries Unsplash for a relevant photo based on the city/state string.
- The first result (if available) is attached to the **`profile_location_updated`** feed item.
- Photo credit metadata is stored alongside the attachment for attribution.
- If Unsplash is down or rate-limited, the feed item still posts without an attachment.

### Visibility rules

- Currently, all location updates appear in friends’ feeds.
- Future updates will incorporate **follower-based visibility** for public/private events and profile changes.

### Developer Notes

- **Frontend** displays these attachments inside the `AttachmentSwiper` component for a smooth swipe-through UI.
- **Backend** enforces type consistency:
  - Dates stored as `Date` objects server-side.
  - Strings for timestamps in API responses.
  - ObjectIds stored for relationships, cast to strings in responses.
- Code changes located in:
  - `PATCH /users/:id` (profile update logic)
  - `UserFeedDoc` model (`target.attachments` & `target.photoCredit`)
  - `AttachmentSwiper` component

## Recent Updates

### 🆕 Features

- **Sticky Mobile Footer Navigation**  
  Added a fixed footer nav bar for mobile view with quick access to:

  - Search
  - My Events
  - Settings
  - Back to Top
  - Direct Messages (DM)

- **Back to Top Floating Button**  
  Added a floating Back to Top button (Lottie animation) positioned bottom-right on main feed for quick scrolling. Tooltip on hover for clarity.

- **Primary-Color Switch Styling**  
  Updated theme toggle switch to retain primary brand background color in both on/off states, ensuring visual consistency.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Duplicate Feed Item Fix**  
  Fixed a race condition that caused duplicate `profile_location_updated` feed entries (one with Unsplash image, one without). Updates now guard against simultaneous PATCH requests and only insert feed items when a real change occurs.

- **Theme Reset to Light Mode**  
  Cleared persisted dark mode settings and enforced light theme as default to prevent unwanted style overrides on inputs/buttons.

  # ThirdSpace

ThirdSpace is a low-pressure social coordination platform that helps friends, communities, and new connections find each other, meet up, and share events — all in real time.

---

## 🚀 Recent Updates (Aug 2025)

### Geospatial Features

- **Interactive Event Maps** — All events now display an embedded, zoomable map powered by MapLibre.
- **Nearby Events API** (`/api/users/:id/get-nearby-events`)
  - Finds events within a given radius of the user.
  - Uses MongoDB `$nearSphere` queries on a `2dsphere` index.
  - Stores coordinates as **GeoJSON Point** `[lng, lat]`.
- **Nearby Users API** (`/api/users/:id/get-nearby-users`)
  - Finds users within a radius that share overlapping tags.
  - Uses `$geoNear` for distance sorting and `$setIntersection` for tag matching.
  - Scores results by tag overlap (weighted) and proximity.
- **Indexes**:
  - `location.geo` (2dsphere) for both events and users.
  - `tags` for faster shared-interest matching.

### Data Improvements

- **Default Location Fallback** — If no coordinates are provided, system uses geocoding or a safe default.
- **AI Keyword Extraction** — Auto-generates tags from bios/interests for better nearby user matching.
- **Type Safety Fixes** — Resolved `number | undefined` issues for lat/lng props.

### UI Fixes

- **Footer Scroll Bug** — Footer hides when scrolling down. visible when when scrolling up (sticky + z-index fix).
- **Smart Refresh Click Target** — “New update available” banner now makes the entire banner clickable, not just the arrow.

---

## 📦 API Endpoints

### **Nearby Events**

Returns users within the radius that share at least `minShared` tags.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Notes

- Ensure MongoDB collections for `users` and `events` have `2dsphere` indexes on `location.geo`.
- Geocoding utilities require environment variable `BASE_URL` for reverse geocoding calls.

---

## 📅 Next Steps

- Add client-side UI for nearby user discovery.
- Improve AI tag extraction fallback and caching.
- Filter nearby events by user interests.

## 📬 Notifications

The app now includes a **notifications system** with global context and UI integration.

### Features

- **Global NotificationsContext**
  - Provides access to `notifications`, `notificationCount`, `accept`, `reject`, `clearAll`, and `refresh`.
  - Polls `/api/notifications` every 60s to keep data fresh.
- **Notifications Modal**
  - Displays all notifications with **filters** (read/unread/type) and **pagination**.
  - Uses **Lottie empty states** for a clean experience when no items are present.
  - Friend requests are displayed with an **accordion-style UI** (expand for Accept/Reject).
  - Bulk actions supported: **mark all read** and **clear all**.
- **Footer Badge**
  - Notification count badge connected to context.
  - Custom small badge styling for a compact display.

### Endpoints

- `GET /api/users/:id/get-notifications` – fetch notifications (with filters/pagination).
- `PATCH /api/users/:id/friend-request/accept` – accept a friend request.
- `PATCH /api/users/:id/friend-request/reject` – reject a friend request.
- `DELETE /api/users/:id/delete-notification` – remove a single notification.
- `DELETE /api/users/:id/read-notification/clear-all` – clear all notifications.

### Implementation Notes

- **Optimistic updates** are used for accept/reject actions (UI updates instantly, rolls back on failure).
- `id` field normalized from MongoDB `_id` for frontend consistency.
- Privacy/permissions are enforced in backend routes where relevant.

## SCRUM-86 - ## Privacy & Visibility (New)

- Added `visibility` field + granular privacy config (`location`, `hostedEvents`, `joinedEvents`, `statusUpdate`).
- Implemented **Profile Settings Modal** with a `VisibilitySettings` select component (glass-style UI).
- Integrated visibility rules into:
  - **Profile API** — block/allow profile fetch based on privacy.
  - **Status API** — status updates only pushed to feeds if allowed by privacy.
  - **Event API** — hosted events pushed to friends/followers feeds only if user’s visibility allows.
  - **Feed Generators** — guards prepared using `canViewerSee(user, viewer, field)` for consistent enforcement.
- Users can now:
  - Set profile visibility to: `Public`, `Followers`, `Friends`, or `Off`.
  - Control whether their **location, hosted events, joined events, and status updates** appear in others’ feeds.

## ✨ Spark Interaction (Double-Tap Support)

Users can double-tap event media to send a **Spark** — a lightweight expression of support.

Sparks:

- Are tied to the canonical event (not feed items)
- Are deduplicated via indexed reactions (1 spark per user per event)
- Trigger a centered pulse animation for immediate feedback
- Do not introduce public popularity metrics

Designed to encourage positive engagement without creating comparison pressure.
